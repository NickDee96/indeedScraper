There are 80 member states, including 54 in Africa (Regional Member Countries). The Bank’s development agenda is delivering the financial and technical support for transformative projects that will significantly reduce poverty through inclusive and sustainable economic growth.
We are recruiting to fill the position below:
Job Position: Fragility and Resilience Officer, RDTS
Reference: ADB/19/185/2
Job Location: Niamey, Niger
Position N°: 50079242
Grade: LP5
The Complex
Within the Regional Development, Integration and Business Delivery Complex (RDVP), the Bank has five (5) Regional Development, Integration and Business Delivery (RDIBD) Directorates, one in each region of Africa: North, South, East, West, and Central. Each Regional Directorate is headed by a Director General (DG) and is staffed with the relevant sectoral functions and administrative capabilities for rapid delivery of services to client countries.
The Regional Directorates provide overall strategic direction to country offices within the regions and are responsible for the Bank’s operations, business development, project management and overall effective delivery of the Bank’s High 5s of ‘Light up and Power Africa,’ ‘Feed Africa,’ ‘Industrialize Africa,’ ‘Integrate Africa,’ ‘Improve the Quality of Life for the People of Africa.

The Hiring Department
The Transition States Coordination Office (RDTS) is responsible for leading and implementing African Development Bank Group (the Bank) Strategy for Addressing Fragility and Building Resilience in its Regional Member Countries. It coordinates the Bank’s work on addressing fragility and building resilience, including activities of all fragility and resilience professionals stationed in the various Regional Hubs or Country Offices. Over the past decade, Africa has seen enormous growth and transformation that has expanded opportunities and improved living conditions for millions of people. More than two-thirds of African countries have strengthened their quality of governance, improved basic services, and expanded economic opportunities. Yet, there are significant risks that this momentum could be undermined by important pressures—continuing patterns of exclusion and poverty, unemployment, high migration, rapid urbanization, climate change and poor management of natural resources—that threaten to overwhelm existing institutional capacities for managing political, economic, social and environmental challenges. These pressures are making every single African country more vulnerable. RDTS aims to place the Bank at the center of Africa’s efforts to address fragility and pave the way for a more resilient and inclusive development trajectory. A major part of RDTS’ activities involves the identification of the main drivers of fragility, including economic, social, political and environmental dimensions, and how the Bank’s programs and projects can contribute to equity and inclusive development.

We Are Cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool."

Our Growth Culture:
One of the reasons our company continues to thrive after 130+ years is having a company culture that supports and rewards behaviors that lead to growth. Our “Growth Behaviors,” as we call them, are ways of being and working that help to make us successful. Think about how you can bring this to life in your next role at Coca-Cola.

Curious
Keep seeking, never settle. Staying curious about what is outside, and two steps ahead inspires us to challenge the status quo. Having the courage to look and leap is the way we grow. Because asking “what if?” pushes us to the next level as people and as a company.

Empowered
Make it happen. True empowerment is the result of taking responsibility. This means giving yourself permission to see it, say it and do it, and owning the outcomes. Because we move forward faster when we all take action.

Version 1.0, 2.0, 3.0
Push for progress, not perfection. There are very few overnight successes. Greatness is borne of many little victories (and failures). Share v 1.0, test it, and make it better. Then create the next version. Because the moment we think something is perfect, it will be obsolete.

Inclusive
Include, value and trust each other. We are smart alone but together we are genius. This means being inclusive, giving the benefit of the doubt and being responsible for each other. Because, for our company to thrive for the next 100+ years, smart isn’t enough. We need genius.

Who We Are
Bridge partners with governments, donors, and parents to ensure that every child has access to an education that develops her full potential and creates the foundation for prosperity for the country. We are dedicated to supporting teachers, empowering school leaders, and ensuring every child has the learning support needed to master the national syllabus and have the confidence to succeed in a competitive world. Each of our project or country teams are supported through expertise and programming from additional offices around the world, combining world-leading expertise in core design areas with locally resident leadership and execution. We leverage experts, data, and technology in order to support and scale every aspect of quality education delivery. Bridge managed and supported schools are technology enabled and data driven to ensure accountability in the classroom for both teachers’ performance and children’s learning.
The Bridge model delivers significant learning outcomes at large scale by combining technology and customized learning materials. At Bridge, we believe innovation and technology can transform learning. Our model – which uses technology to deliver thoroughly researched and carefully designed daily lesson guides to teachers in our academies – is proven to increase learning outcomes for children. We are a solutions-driven, implementation-focused organization, using design principles to work in varied and often highly constrained contexts to ensure learning outcomes and positive development for children. Working in regional and national scales is important to us, as empowering entire generations of children with core knowledge, skills, and confidence is what builds the foundation for a peaceful and prosperous future for us all.
Our mission is to provide our pupils with a life-changing education and we believe that every child should have a right to world-class education regardless of her family’s income. Core to our approach is the conviction that every child can learn, as long as the school she attends is committed to her development and puts her needs to learn at the forefront of all decisions. We have seen teachers and children transform and excel in both government and private schools that we support and manage.
We invite you to join this incredible endeavor that is having world-changing impact across multiple continents. You will join a team of dedicated change-makers committed to ensuring that each decision we make keeps a child’s experience of learning as its guiding principle.
Nigeria
The education crisis is one that requires urgent, collective, and concrete action to surmount. While Nigeria is said to have the largest number of out of school children in the world, the education crisis is not just about out of school children, but also about children who are in school and not learning. In Sub Saharan Africa, statistics say that 88% or almost 9 out of 10 children and adolescents will not be able to read proficiently by the time they are of age to complete primary and lower secondary Education. With Nigeria being the most populous country in Sub Saharan Africa, this crisis impacts us most.
Bridge started operations in Nigeria in 2015, opening its affordable private nursery and primary schools targeted at providing life changing education for families living in low-income areas of Lagos State in parts of Ikorodu, Alimosho, Badagry, Ojo, Epe, and other local government areas. In 2017, Bridge further expanded its reach to the most marginalized and vulnerable communities by partnering with the Nigeria Stock Exchange (NSE) and the State of Borno to set up a public school serving out-of-school children and children from internally displaced communities. In 2018, Bridge became technical partners to the Edo State government in its implementation of the Edo State Basic Education Sector Transformation program to reform its public primary and nursery school system.
Today, Bridge works with both communities and governments to ensure hundreds of thousands of children have access to either a well-run, high achieving affordable private or free public school so that the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 4 of Quality Education becomes a reality for the millions of children in Nigeria quickly. You will join a group of Nigerians taking concrete action to help address the education crisis in Nigeria and ensure a better future for the children of Nigeria.
Strategy Group
The Strategy Group at Bridge is responsible for our overall direction in education service, designing our verbal and visual brand, communicating our work internally and externally, providing insight into the ecosystems within which we work, measuring the impact of our programs, engaging our government partners in programming, ensuring regulatory compliance, and expanding the reach of our services into new geographies. Creative, Public Relations, Insights, Measurement & Evaluation, Policy & Partnerships, and New Opportunities are all departments within the Strategy Group. Collaboration between and coordination of each of these department’s functions is critical to ensure that every child has access to an education that develops her full potential and creates the foundation for prosperity for the country.

Policy & Partnerships Department
The Policy & Partnerships team (P&P) leads the Bridge movement to transform lives of millions of children through education. We lead pioneering efforts to revitalize Government-led delivery of education across the world. We engage with visionary political and Government leadership to help shape policy, strengthen delivery and impact complex education systems through public private partnerships. We also engage with other dynamic influencers (NGO, donors, think-tanks and academicians) to unlock news ways of partnering to make high-quality education accessible to every child in underserved communities.

About the Role
You will help Bridge meet legislative goals by creating policy proposals and working with government agencies. You are on top of research on government policies and laws, manage internal and external communication and have a large resource base of personnel in the public sector.

What You Will Do
Support Government Relations – Support the Government relations Manager in coordinating complex interactions with our regulators, including but not limited to, legislators, Members of Parliament, Local Government Officials, Ministry officials, etc.
Stakeholder mapping and engagement – Manage broader strategic stakeholder management with NGO/donor/think tank/academic and other important 'influencers'. Both in the hopes of obtaining material support for our communities and also managing our broader relations/standing with this important community;
Public private partnerships – Identify opportunities and work with partners in the private sector to drive efficient service delivery with government schools;
Policy – Work with key stakeholders on consultative efforts to drive reforms in delivery of education to underserved communities;
Support strategy drive – Support the Government relations Manager to establish and implement short- and long-range goals, objectives, policies and operating procedures for government and stakeholder relations; monitor and evaluates program effectiveness; and effect changes required for improvement.
What You Should Have
At least 4 years’ experience in public affairs, government relations, stakeholder engagement and/or partnerships, experience in the Ministry of Education preferred,
Extensive knowledge of national and district government organisation and legislative processes in primary education;
Rolodex of contacts within the Ministry of Education, NCDC and UNEB, as well as NGOs, major philanthropists and education organisations;
Knowledge of district and national government issues related to the provision of primary education;
Experience working for a political, non-profit, or other social campaigns that concern an idea or a movement rather than a product.

You’re also A detailed doer – You have a track record of getting things done. You’re organized and responsive. You take ownership of every idea you touch and execute it to a fine level of detail, setting targets, engaging others, and doing whatever it takes to get the job done. You can multi-task dozens of such projects at once and never lose sight of the details. Likely, you have some experience in a start-up or other rapid-growth company. A creative problem-solver – Growing any business from scratch comes with massive and constant challenges. On top of that, Bridge works in often fragile, sometimes volatile low-resource communities and with complex government systems. You need to be flexible and ready to get everything done effectively, quickly, and affordably with the materials at hand.
 A relentless advocate – The children we serve and teachers we empower never leave your mind. You know them, get them, have shared a meal with them (or would be happy to in the future). You would never shrink back from shaking a parent’s hand or picking up a crying child, no matter what the person was wearing or looked like. Every decision you make considers their benefit, experience, and value. A malleable learner – You believe you can always do better. You welcome constructive criticism and provide it freely to others. You know you only get better tomorrow when others point out where you’ve missed things or failed today. A data-driven decision-maker – When making decisions, you don’t rely your intuition alone. You collect data, you analyze it and make decisions with clear justifications. A curious investigator – You ask why a lot. You don’t just take what you see and accept it. You wonder why it is that way, and are aware that the world we see is created by human choices and actions – and it could be different. You wonder, and see the world as wonderful even when you want to change a part of it that is unjust.

Who We Are
Bridge partners with governments, donors, and parents to ensure that every child has access to an education that develops her full potential and creates the foundation for prosperity for the country. We are dedicated to supporting teachers, empowering school leaders, and ensuring every child has the learning support needed to master the national syllabus and have the confidence to succeed in a competitive world. Each of our project or country teams are supported through expertise and programming from additional offices around the world, combining world-leading expertise in core design areas with locally resident leadership and execution. We leverage experts, data, and technology in order to support and scale every aspect of quality education delivery. Bridge managed and supported schools are technology enabled and data driven to ensure accountability in the classroom for both teachers’ performance and children’s learning.
The Bridge model delivers significant learning outcomes at large scale by combining technology and customized learning materials. At Bridge, we believe innovation and technology can transform learning. Our model – which uses technology to deliver thoroughly researched and carefully designed daily lesson guides to teachers in our academies – is proven to increase learning outcomes for children. We are a solutions-driven, implementation-focused organization, using design principles to work in varied and often highly constrained contexts to ensure learning outcomes and positive development for children. Working in regional and national scales is important to us, as empowering entire generations of children with core knowledge, skills, and confidence is what builds the foundation for a peaceful and prosperous future for us all.
Our mission is to provide our pupils with a life-changing education and we believe that every child should have a right to world-class education regardless of her family’s income. Core to our approach is the conviction that every child can learn, as long as the school she attends is committed to her development and puts her needs to learn at the forefront of all decisions. We have seen teachers and children transform and excel in both government and private schools that we support and manage.
We invite you to join this incredible endeavor that is having world-changing impact across multiple continents. You will join a team of dedicated change-makers committed to ensuring that each decision we make keeps a child’s experience of learning as its guiding principle.
Nigeria
The education crisis is one that requires urgent, collective, and concrete action to surmount. While Nigeria is said to have the largest number of out of school children in the world, the education crisis is not just about out of school children, but also about children who are in school and not learning. In Sub Saharan Africa, statistics say that 88% or almost 9 out of 10 children and adolescents will not be able to read proficiently by the time they are of age to complete primary and lower secondary Education. With Nigeria being the most populous country in Sub Saharan Africa, this crisis impacts us most.
Bridge started operations in Nigeria in 2015, opening its affordable private nursery and primary schools targeted at providing life changing education for families living in low-income areas of Lagos State in parts of Ikorodu, Alimosho, Badagry, Ojo, Epe, and other local government areas. In 2017, Bridge further expanded its reach to the most marginalized and vulnerable communities by partnering with the Nigeria Stock Exchange (NSE) and the State of Borno to set up a public school serving out-of-school children and children from internally displaced communities. In 2018, Bridge became technical partners to the Edo State government in its implementation of the Edo State Basic Education Sector Transformation program to reform its public primary and nursery school system.
Today, Bridge works with both communities and governments to ensure hundreds of thousands of children have access to either a well-run, high achieving affordable private or free public school so that the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 4 of Quality Education becomes a reality for the millions of children in Nigeria quickly. You will join a group of Nigerians taking concrete action to help address the education crisis in Nigeria and ensure a better future for the children of Nigeria.

Creative, Public Relations, Insights, Measurement & Evaluation, Policy & Partnerships, and New Opportunities are all departments within the Strategy Group. Collaboration between and coordination of each of these department’s functions is critical to ensure that every child has access to an education that develops her full potential and creates the foundation for prosperity for the country.

Public Relations Department
The Public Relations team at Bridge is housed with the Strategy group and collaborate across departments to ensure that Bridge is telling its story both locally and globally in the most compelling way. Public Relations is responsible for a wide range of activities including digital communications, external relations, advocacy, reputation management and media. We are focused on ensuring that the work that Bridge is doing to improving learning outcomes for hundreds of thousands of children reaches a wide audience.

Every decision you make considers their benefit, experience, and value. A malleable learner – You believe you can always do better. You welcome constructive criticism and provide it freely to others. You know you only get better tomorrow when others point out where you’ve missed things or failed today. A data-driven decision-maker – When making decisions, you don’t rely your intuition alone. You collect data, you analyze it and make decisions with clear justifications. A curious investigator – You ask why a lot. You don’t just take what you see and accept it. You wonder why it is that way, and are aware that the world we see is created by human choices and actions – and it could be different. You wonder, and see the world as wonderful even when you want to change a part of it that is unjust.

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool."

Recruitment Privacy Notice
As part of any recruitment process, Nagwa collects and processes personal data relating to job applicants. Nagwa is committed to being transparent about how it collects and uses that data and to meeting its data protection obligations.
What information does Nagwa collect?
Nagwa collects a range of information about you. This includes:
your name, address and contact details, including email address and telephone number;
details of your qualifications, skills, experience and employment history;
information about the date you applied, email correspondence, writing sample assessment, comments and rating;
whether or not you have a disability for which Nagwa needs to make reasonable adjustments during the recruitment process;
information about your entitlement to work in the UK; and
equal opportunities monitoring information, including information about your ethnic origin, sexual orientation, health, and religion or belief.
Nagwa collects this information in a variety of ways. For example, data might be contained in application forms, CVs or resumes, obtained from your passport or other identity documents, or collected through interviews or other forms of assessment, including online tests.
Nagwa will also collect personal data about you from third parties, such as references supplied by former employers, information from employment background check providers and information from criminal records checks. Nagwa will seek information from third parties only once a job offer to you has been made and will inform you that it is doing so.
Data will be stored in a range of different places, including on your application record, in HR management systems and on other IT systems (including email).
Why does Nagwa process personal data?
Nagwa needs to process data to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract with you. It also needs to process your data to enter into a contract with you.
In some cases, Nagwa needs to process data to ensure that it is complying with its legal obligations. For example, it is required to check a successful applicant's eligibility to work in the UK before employment starts.
Nagwa has a legitimate interest in processing personal data during the recruitment process and for keeping records of the process. Processing data from job applicants allows Nagwa to manage the recruitment process, assess and confirm a candidate's suitability for employment and decide to whom to offer a job. Nagwa may also need to process data from job applicants to respond to and defend against legal claims.
Where Nagwa relies on legitimate interests as a reason for processing data, it has considered whether or not those interests are overridden by the rights and freedoms of employees or workers and has concluded that they are not.
Nagwa processes health information if it needs to make reasonable adjustments to the recruitment process for candidates who have a disability. This is to carry out its obligations and exercise specific rights in relation to employment.
Where Nagwa processes other special categories of data, such as information about ethnic origin, sexual orientation, health or religion or belief, this is for equal opportunities monitoring purposes.
For some roles, Nagwa is obliged to seek information about criminal convictions and offences. Where Nagwa seeks this information, it does so because it is necessary for it to carry out its obligations and exercise specific rights in relation to employment.
Nagwa will not use your data for any purpose other than the recruitment exercise for which you have applied.
If your application is unsuccessful, Nagwa may keep your personal data on file in case there are future employment opportunities for which you may be suited. Nagwa will ask for your consent before it keeps your data for this purpose and you are free to withdraw your consent at any time.

How does Nagwa protect data?
Nagwa takes the security of your data seriously. It has internal policies and controls in place to ensure that your data is not lost, accidentally destroyed, misused or disclosed, and is not accessed except by our employees in the proper performance of their duties. Nagwa uses encryption, secure socket layer, firewall, password protection, and other physical and logical security measures to help prevent unauthorized access to data. Nagwa also places internal restrictions on who in the company may access data to help prevent unauthorized access to such information.

access and obtain a copy of your data on request;
require Nagwa to change incorrect or incomplete data;
require Nagwa to delete or stop processing your data, for example where the data is no longer necessary for the purposes of processing;
object to the processing of your data where Nagwa is relying on its legitimate interests as the legal ground for processing; and
ask Nagwa to stop processing data for a period if data is inaccurate or there is a dispute about whether or not your interests override Nagwa's legitimate grounds for processing data.
If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please email Paula Dixon at paula.dixon@nagwa.com. You can make a subject access request by completing Nagwa's form for making a subject access request.
If you believe that Nagwa has not complied with your data protection rights, you can complain to the Information Commissioner.

You are under no obligation to provide information for equal opportunities monitoring purposes and there are no consequences for your application if you choose not to provide such information.

We are currently seeking a motivated, career and customer oriented User Interface (UI) Developer to join our team in Alexandria, VA to begin an exciting and challenging career with Unisys Federal Systems.


Working within the Common Framework Team (UX group), the User Interface (UI) Developer will have two main roles.

The first responsibility will be to build out highly reusable components based on direction from the UX team.

The developer should have proficiency in building lean semantic code, managing multiple dependencies, and providing cutting edge expertise in bringing clean, modern UI to life. Familiarity with existing design systems/frameworks is highly encouraged but what is absolutely essential is having the knowledge to edit and create these systems.
The second main duty is to assist the UX team in consulting with individual application development teams to assist them in implementing the aforementioned design system and provide guidance when custom solutions are necessary. The right candidate should be comfortable with public speaking and working with your UX lead to provide technical advice during consultations.

This position develops assets that will need to be readily ingestible by a variety of teams. What you develop will need to take into account the needs of the enterprise not just a single application.Ability to work within and setup an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).Ability to work within (and at times outside of) an agile work schedule.Be able to manage versioning and publishing via Github.Familiarity with testing best practices and be able to debug/solve common code problems.Ability to work with both PC and Mac OSX preferable.

Engineering Manager,5bd9d4392f9dd6cb,"About us

Following successes like SnapScan, UCook and WooCommerce, we’re building a new startup backed by some of SA’s most renowned investors and founders.

We’re building a new platform to be used in the workplace with a proven model and a lot of customer research behind it. We’d be happy to tell you more about the model and product in person, but for now know that we’re building tooling to make people’s lives better at work, and to solve some really archaic workflows overlooked in everyday processes. We’re also linking this work pretty closely to things people are willing to pay for; no pie-in-the-sky thinking here. We’re building a real business with real revenue goals in the near future.

We’re very early stage and with that comes a host of opportunities. Talk to almost anyone that’s seen a startup from idea through scale and they’ll reminisce about the early days: working closely together and iterating quickly. Those days are here for us now, and if you want to share that then this is your shot.

You won’t find layers of middle managers here. We work towards common goals and shared learnings, but this is largely a space for taking initiative and building (fast).
Being very early stage also means that we’re all generalists and this isn't a well carved out corporate gig. Expect loads of emphasis on creativity and execution, and a focus on customers / users. You’ll be exposed to all aspects of the business: we don’t believe in silos and don’t see people are resources or cogs in a machine - we’re too busy figuring out what the machine should look like.

About the role

This is an opportunity to help build a product from scratch, and a core part of that will be how our users engage with payroll. We’ll be expanding on our domain knowledge, and you’ll be leading this charge to become the key expert in payroll and payroll tooling. Initially, this will mean administering payroll for a few companies and using that knowledge to inform our product development. There is a lot of growth opportunity here though, with this role expanding to other areas of the business and leading different teams.
Don’t expect this job to be a typical clerking gig: we want you to be a core member of the team and to make sure everyone understands our clients’ needs to properly make decisions in every aspect of the business. With that in mind you should be very comfortable (and enjoy) explaining finance topics to people from other disciplines (like engineering).
You’ll get help from the CEO and other team members, but expect to be very involved with the sales and business development process too. To that end, experience recruiting clients will be very beneficial to you.

While not exhaustive, the following should give you a good idea of what the role will entail:

Working with companies to administer their payroll and make sure their related compliance requirements are met
Working with the product team to make sure we’re building the right tools and making your life (and our clients’ lives) easier
Becoming the expert on all things payroll in this market (and to some extent abroad). We’d want you to be the compliance expert and to drive an overall clear understanding throughout the organisation of the industry and particularly the pain points for our users

Perks

Flexible work hours (we care about goals achieved, not bums in seats)
Get in on the ground floor of the next huge b2b startup
Market related salary
Good coffee
Happy, fun work environment. Shape the culture with us!


While we're open-minded and looking for talent and aptitude vs. an exact CV match, this should describe you pretty closely:
You've preferably got a tertiary qualification in finance
You’ve probably got 2+ years experience as a financial manager or tax accountant
You are broadly curious. We’re early stage, and have a bias for generalists
You have a bias for building, you create more than you consume
You are either Cape Town based or are OK with getting to the office a few days a week."

We also encourage all our staff to incorporate their aspirations and interests into their career at Ten and we are there every step of the way in supporting development.
All our employees also enjoy a range of benefits regardless of where they are based. Not only do we enjoy monthly Treats on Ten (on the tenth of each month!) but employees also get 3 extra days of annual leave in their third year and an extra month of every 5 years. In line with these milestone lengths of service, we also operate a Ten Loyalty Reward program – this is a bonus (although we prefer to refer to this as ‘extra spending money’) that is awarded once these milestones are reached. The thinking behind the program is that not only does it recognise and reward commitment and loyalty to the business, but it can also be used to fund the adventures to be had during sabbaticals – this is the main intention and driving force behind the program. We want to give our people extra spending money so that they can truly enjoy their sabbaticals.
Other benefits that Ten offer, specific to the South Africa office, range between access to ICAS Employee Health and Wellness (EHWP) services which are confidential and free for all employees to use, all the way through to various discounts on both travel and entertainment events (the latter is of course available regardless of location). There are also lots of social events throughout the year as well as a break-out room where employees can relax (or, if they wish, play one of the numerous games we provide!) whilst enjoying our latest fruit drop.
We also offer a company contribution towards medical aid, transport home for those working a late shift (applies to those who don't have a car) and, one of our more popular perks, working holiday opportunities with the ability to work from any of our 20+ offices without taking annual leave."

Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco,

where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!

UNICEF works in some of the world’s toughest places, to reach the world’s most disadvantaged children. To save their lives. To defend their rights. To help them fulfill their potential.

Across 190 countries and territories, we work for every child, everywhere, every day, to build a better world for everyone.

And we never give up.

For every child, a voice

The fundamental mission of UNICEF is to promote the rights of every child, everywhere, in everything the organization does — in programmes, in advocacy and in operations. The equity strategy, emphasizing the most disadvantaged and excluded children and families, translates this commitment to children’s rights into action. For UNICEF, equity means that all children have an opportunity to survive, develop and reach their full potential, without discrimination, bias or favoritism. To the degree that any child has an unequal chance in life — in its social, political, economic, civic and cultural dimensions — her or his rights are violated. There is growing evidence that investing in the health, education and protection of a society’s most disadvantaged citizens — addressing inequity — not only will give all children the opportunity to fulfill their potential but also will lead to sustained growth and stability of countries. This is why the focus on equity is so vital. It accelerates progress towards realizing the human rights of all children, which is the universal mandate of UNICEF, as outlined by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, while also supporting the equitable development of nations.
